# Dataset created for the Power Line Insulators Inspection Detections (PLIID Dataset)

Dataset created for the Power Line Insulators Inspection Detections. This dataset contains 600 images of normal insulators captured by UAVs in China from the Power Line Insulators Dataset (CPLID) and 500 images of normal insolators captured by UAVs from Colombia by us.

The Chinese Power Line Insolator (CPLID) dataset is getting from:

    Detection of Power Line Insulator Defects Using Aerial Images Analyzed With Convolutional Neural Networks 
    IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 2018
    https://github.com/InsulatorData/InsulatorDataSet

The PLIID Dataset contains 1100 images of normal insulators divided into three parts:

- `train` contains the normal insolators for the training dataset


- `validation` contains the normal insolators for the validation dataset


- `test` contains the normal insolators for the testing dataset


The three directories contain two subdirectories, one called `images` contains the image files, the other called `annotations` contains the VOC2007 format annotations.
